# pong-game

pong is a clasic arcade game , probably one of the first arcade game that ever was.it's basically just a ball that's going acros a table and two players each control a paddle bouncing the ball back and forth . if you miss the ball, then the other player scores a point.

the structure of this game is that we have a two-player game and then make the ball move constantly across the screen .
and figure out when it collides with a wall and make it bounce and then detect when there's a collision with the paddle to know when to bounce it back.
finally we'll figure out when a user scores , when the paddle misses the ball , and we'll keep the score using a scoreborad
